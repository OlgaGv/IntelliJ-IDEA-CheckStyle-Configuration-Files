# IntelliJ IDEA CheckStyle Configuration Files
All the configuration files used to code in IntelliJ IDEA for the CheckStyle plugin. As of right, this project has two configuration files:
* Android
* Java

## Configuration Files
### Android
The Android configuration file is based on the [Android Code Style](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) provided by Google. The original code is from [Jens Kohl](https://gist.github.com/jk/4370929), which itself is forked from [Fred Grott](https://gist.github.com/shareme/948425).

### Java
The Java configuration file is based on the [Google Java Style](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). The code is a copy from the [Google Checks](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) provided by CheckStyle.

## Installation
Once you are in the main screen of the IDE, access the Settings in the File menu. If you have not open a project, you can still find the Settings in the Configure menu. If you have installed the [CheckStyle plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065), you'll find the CheckStyle menu in the Other Settings menu. Under Configuration File, click the green plus sign and a window will open where you can add a Description for the file and point the plugin to the file on your computer or on the Internet.
